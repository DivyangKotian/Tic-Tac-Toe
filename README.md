# Tic Tac Toe 

A classic Tic Tac Toe game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project features a sleek dark theme with an electric neon aesthetic, allowing players to enjoy a nostalgic game with modern design elements.

## Key Features

- **Single Player Mode**: Play against a computer opponent with adjustable difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard).
- **Player Symbol Selection**: Players can choose to be X or O before starting the game.
- **Responsive Design**: The game interface adjusts seamlessly across various screen sizes.
- **Neon Themed UI**: A vibrant neon color scheme with animations for a lively user experience.
- **Game State Management**: Automatic checks for wins, draws, and game resets.
- **Custom Buttons and Sliders** : The buttons allow for a smooth user experience while keeping the theme alive.

## Future Features

- **Two Player Mode**: An option to play against another human player locally.
- **Enhanced AI**: Implement alpha-beta pruning to make sure AI can truly use minimax algorith to maybe even add an imposibble level, for now i just want level 3 to be hard, hence the first move is random on difficulty 3.
- **Score Tracking**: Implementing a scoreboard to track wins, losses, and draws over multiple games.
- **Customizable Themes**: Allow players to choose from various themes and color schemes.

## Limitations of Current Build

- The AI may not always provide a challenging experience, especially at the Easy level.
- No multiplayer functionality; the current setup only supports local play vs an AI.
- Limited visual effects; additional animations and transitions could enhance user experience.
- Currently, the game does not save the state or scores between sessions.
